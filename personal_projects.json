    "description": "<h3>Problem description</h3>\n\n<p>\n    Discretizing a space with a fixed number of points is usually trivial. Most of the time a uniform distribution fits our needs because there is no specific interest in any range inside the given space. That actually means that the uniformly distributed points we assign will match the uniform distribution of the <strong>continuous</strong> points that we need. So when we search the nearest neighbour of a given continuous point, the <strong>mean distance</strong> of the corresponding discrete point will be the minimum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Nevertheless, sometimes there are some places inside the given range with higher interest. These places can be specific ranges or points that we need more often which makes the uniform discretization not optimal. An increased resolution in this range would give us a lower average distance on the searches.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    This raises some questions though. Where to increase the resolution and how much? And if we increase the resolution in a region, it's necessary to decrease the resolution in another region in order to keep the number of points stable.\n</p>\n\n<img src=\"res%2Fadiscr%2FScreenshot 2023-11-21 012356.png\" alt=\"Image 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"200\" /><img src=\"res%2Fadiscr%2FScreenshot 2023-11-21 012452.png\" alt=\"Image 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"300\" />\n\n<h3>My solution (a brief explanation)</h3>\n\n<p>\n    In this library, I propose a solution that makes possible the adaption of the discretized points in an automated way.

    "description": "<h3>Summary</h3><img src=\"res%2Fthesis%2FScreenshot 2023-11-21 013200.png\" alt=\"Image 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\" />\n\n<p>\n    Reinforcement Learning is a Machine Learning technique, where a decision-making algorithm, also known as an autonomous agent, interacts with an (unknown) environment by making observations and taking actions, while it is receiving positive or negative rewards at each step based on its performance. During this process, the agent tries to learn an optimal decision-making policy, namely which action selections at each state will help to maximize the expected total reward in the long term. This technique is ideal for optimal control problems, games, and many other domains.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Many RL architectures use a discrete set of actions to represent a continuous Cartesian action space, and the agent is called to select one of these discrete actions at each time step. Usually, this discretization of a continuous action space reduces the ability of the agent to take actions that perform best, since the agent is forced to choose among the discrete actions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    There are two alternative solutions to this problem: either increase the density of discrete points, which affects the responsiveness of the agent, or adopt a discretization of variable resolution which adapts to the needs of the problem. In this thesis, we present a method for creating discretizations able to adapt dynamically according to the use of the action space. The proposed adaptive discretization can match automatically a wide variety of different patterns in a few adaptation steps while maintaining a constant number of discrete points. We embed this adaptive discretization method into the action space of a particular Deep RL agent performing in specific environments that require precision. Our adaptive discretizations take advantage of the selective use the agent makes over the action space and adjust the density of the discrete points in the space, giving an increased number of discrete actions and thus higher resolution to regions where it is needed. As a result, the agentâ€™s precision and learning performance is increased, without a significant increase in computational resources.\n</p>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<p>My <a href=\"http://purl.tuc.gr/dl/dias/33218A13-C811-425E-BC8B-8D5226842B6F\">Diploma Thesis PDF</a></p>\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07679\">this paper</a></p>\n",

With the knowledge of the Q-value, we can then select the actions that lead to the next best state for any given situation and finally maximise the total reward.
