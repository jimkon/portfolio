No Supervised Machine Learning methods are used and that's intentional. Goal was to experiment with\n    OpenCV and the standard CV techniques for de-noising and processing an image, recognize patterns and provide \n    visualization.\n</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"res%2Ffull%20solution.gif\"  width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"full solution\" /></div>\n\n<p>There are 5 stages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Clear the image from the noise</strong> so only the sudoku puzzle is left in the image</li>\n    <li><strong>Find the pattern of the grid</strong> and extract the sudoku with the digits</li>\n    <li><strong>Locate and identify the digits</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Find the solution of the sudoku</strong> (out of scope for this project)</li>\n    <li><strong>Present the solution back</strong> to the original image</li>\n</ul>\n\n",
